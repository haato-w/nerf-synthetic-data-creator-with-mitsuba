- This code generate nerf-synthetic training data of training.<br>
- `renderer.py` renders a scene using Mistuba. Please edit this file to make your scene.<br>
- `making_synthetic_data.py` makes nerf-synthetic data using `renderer.py`. You can adjust any parameters including camera params, the number of generated data, etc. I made almost same code with original nerf-synthetic data creator in Mitsuba.<br>
- `renderer.py` has main function and you can run the code by it self. I recommend render a sample image using it.
- Below images are generated by these code from [Cem Yuksel hair model](http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/hairmodels/ "cem yulsel page").
